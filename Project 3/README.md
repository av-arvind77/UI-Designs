# Project 3
# Query a Digital Music store Database

In this project, you have to query the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a
music store. For this project, you will be assisting the Chinook team with understanding the media in
their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. To assist you in the 
queries ahead, the schema for the Chinook Database is provided below. You can see the columns 
that link tables together via the arrows.

## Download DB Browser for SQLite
There are many different database browsers that work with different types of databases. For this course, we'll be using the DB Browser for SQLite. The other browsers you may use will likely be very similar.

DB Browser for SQLite can be downloaded here: http://sqlitebrowser.org/


## Connect the Browser to the Database
Here are the steps:

- Open up DB Browser to SQLite
- Click on Open Database
- Navigate to the Chinook.db file (probably in your downloads)
- Click on the Execute SQL
- Start querying your data
